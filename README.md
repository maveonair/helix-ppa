# helix-ppa

This repository contains the source which is used to build the Debian package for [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) and publish it to my personal PPA: [ppa:maveonair/helix-editor](https://launchpad.net/~maveonair/+archive/ubuntu/helix-editor)

## TODO

- [ ] Add documentation how to build a binary
- [ ] Add documentation how to build a source package which can be published to a PPA
